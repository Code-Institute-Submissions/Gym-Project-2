<h1>Getting Started In The Gym</h1>

<p>Getting started in the gym can be daunting. We've all felt the feeling of walking into a gym full of people lifting heavy weights and thinking we're the only one that has no clue what we're doing<br>
I hated this feeling when I was starting out and for this reason, I spent hours researching. This was to get the best results possible for the work I put in but also just to look like I knew what I was doing and calm my nerves. <br>
My Goal with this website is to calm the nerves and aid the progress of every beginner that visits my site.</p>
