<h1>Getting Started In The Gym</h1>

<img src="assets/getstarted.jpg" alt="'Start Making Changes' written in wood blocks" class="getstarted">

<p>Getting started in the gym can be daunting. We've all felt the feeling of walking into a gym full of people lifting heavy weights and thinking we're the only one that has no clue what we're doing<br>
I hated this feeling when I was starting out and for this reason, I spent hours researching. This was to get the best results possible for the work I put in but also just to look like I knew what I was doing and calm my nerves. <br>
My Goal with this website is to calm the nerves and aid the progress of every beginner that visits my site.</p>

<p>I started my research with Reddit forums which lead me to some notable Youtube channels which will be linked in the resource page <a href="resources.html">here</a>.<br>
This is where I learned about the importance of having a <a href="split.html">Workout Split</a> along with some knowlege on <a href="nutrition.html">Nutrition and Suppliments</a></p>

<p>As I said, my goal is to ease your nerves and get you started in the gym, so let's get started! Have a look around the site and soak up the knowlege compiled from hours of research done by yours truely</p>
