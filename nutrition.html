<h1>Nutrition and Suppliments.</h1>
<p>I'm no nutritionist and to be honest it's one part that I know least about if we were to go in to detail.<br>
But it can be simplified for when we're starting out, it doesn't need to be all that complicated.</p>
<h2>Protein</h2>
<p>I'm sure even without doing research into started the gym you would be of the impression that you need protein to grow muscle. Well it's true but how much do you need?<br>
    The general rule of thumb is to take in around 1g of protein per lb of lean body mass. It's hard to know your lean body mass without a scan or an electronic body mass scale so we will have to estimate.<br>
    As everyone's bodyfat percentage varies it's hard to give a definitive answer for this but in general try to stick to at least 0.8g of protein per lb of total body weight</p>
    <p>Most of your protein intake should come from a food source. Common sources for protein are meat, eggs and dairy. Chicken is a brilliant source of protein and is a lean meat so try to eat as much of this as you can.<br>
    If you're finding it hard to hit your protein intake with food alone you can suppliment this with proetin powder. This can be taken at any time of the day (the idea that it needs to be right after a workout is a myth).</p>

<h2>Suppliments</h2>
<p>Suppliments aren't a nessecary part of gaining muscle, but they can help you get that little extra edge.<br>
A lot of the suppliments out there are just a sink hole for your money so I only use a select few which are seen as the "holy trinity" of suppliments.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Protein Powder</li>
    <li>Pre-Workout(Caffine)</li>
    <li>Creatine</li>
</ul>

<h3>Protein Powder</h3>
<p>Protein powder, as stated above, can just help us to reach our protein goals. It's not even 100% needed but can be useful<br>
    Here is a video explaining more in-depth about pre-workout if you're interested: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42PTdcxTfpc&ab_channel=JeremyEthier" target="_blank">Protein Powder</a></p>

<h3>Pre-Workout</h3>
<p>Pre-workout can give you a boost in the gym and help you push out some extra reps. Again not 100% needed but definetley helps.<br>
    One problem with pre-workout is building a tolerence to it. This can lead to you needed more and more to feel the effects.<br>
    This can also lead to you feeling dependant on it, so when you don't take it you feel like you can't get a good workout in.<br>
For these reasons I would recommend cycling on and off pre-workout and not taking it for every session.<br>

<h2>Creatine</h2>
<p>Creatine is the suppliment with the most research gone into it and most evidence for actually having a direct impact on muscle gain.<br>
Creatine soaks your muscles and brings more water to them. This increases their performance and allows you to squeeze out 1 or 2 more reps. It will cause you to gain some water weight but this is expected.<br>
It is reccomended to take around 3-5g a day. People speak about doing a "loading phase" but this is not needed. Just take around 5g a day and after a couple weeks you will have enough in your body.<br>
