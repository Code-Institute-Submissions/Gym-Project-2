<h1>Resources</h1>

<p>Here I will list some useful people who were the source and inspiration for most of my content on this site. Some people weren't linked to in the site but are very inspirational towards my routine and content.</p>
<h2>Jeff Nippard</h2>
<p>Jeff Nippard has some great content for beginners and more advanced lifters. He presents science based information in a concise and easily understandable format for viewers. Knowing the reason behind why we are doing a specific exercise or routine really helps me with deciding on what to do in the gym.</p>

<h2>Greg Doucette</h2>
    <p>Coach Greg is an aquired taste. When you first start watching him you may be deterred by his high pitched shout and high energy but it becomes something you enjoy about him after a while. He's a no nonsense type of coach for everyone on the internet. He calls out others that are giving useless information and helps with body image issues some may experience when first starting in the gym.<br>
    It's easy to start looking at fitness influencers and think you can achieve their body in a couple of years, but Coach Gregg grounds us and tells us how it really is with his "Natty or Not" videos. His motto is "Harder than Last Time" which is a simplified way of saying you need to introduce progressive overload.</p>

<h2>Joe Delaney</h2>
    <p>Joe Delaney is an informative and no nonsense type of youtuber too. He does this in a much more laid-back style which is appealing to me. He provides information as well as anecdotal reasons behind his videos. He seems to be authentic and geniune which is what stands out for me.</p>

<h2>Jonni Shreeve</h2>
    <p>Jonni Shreeve is a great watch for perfecting form and getting the most out of your work. He gives very informative cues and pointers on each lift. He also critiques other coaches' videos and youtube videos of people lifting.<br>
         These type of videos really helped me when trying to get form down when starting out in the gym.</p>

<h2>Jeremy Ethier</h2>
    <p>Similar to Jeff Nuppard with science based tips and form videos explaining how to perform some lifts, Jeremy is a very useful resource</p>

<h2>Chris Bumstead</h2>
    <p>Chris Bumstead is the now 3-time Mr.Olympia Classic Physique winner. He has documented is journey the whole way with entertaining vlogs, gym/workout videos full of tips and knowlege. Chris is a can't miss if you ask me. Who wouldn't want to learn from the 3x world's best?</p>

<h2>Will Tennyson</h2>
    <p>Will provides information with a comedic element to it but his videos are still extremely informative. He does more "youtuber" type videos too if entertainment is what you're looking for along with just information. These include eating challenges etc.</p>
