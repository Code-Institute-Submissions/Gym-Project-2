    <h1>The Routine</h1>
    
    <p>Below I will be speaking about a split that I found really suited me. <br>
    These splits are subjective and each person prefers a different routine but I'll give you so reasons and information as to why I opt for the Push, Pull, Legs Split</p>
    
    <p>If you wish to learn about different workout splits I reccomend the following video explaining the benefits and draw-backs of some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O8mOtdKr44" target="_blank">popular splits</a></p>
    <p>So the goal is to hit each muscle group as close to twice a week as possible. This will be a 3 day on - 1 day off routine. I'll explain more below.</p>
    <h2>Progressive Overload and Compound Movements</h2>
    <p>We will be focussing primarily on compound movements and progressive overload in this split. These two terms reference the two most important factors in building strength and muscle as a beginner.</p>
    <h3>Progressive Overload</h3>
    <p>Progressive overload is the act of constantly making the workout harder on your muscles. This can be done by adding weight, adding reps or even just changing the way to do each set, i.e Slower reps.</p>
    <p>The reason we impliment progressive overload is so that our muscles always have a reason to grow and increase in strength. If we are constantly asking more of them they will need to grow to accomodate this change.<br>
    In essence, if we want our muscles to be more than they were before we have to make them do more than they have done before.</p>
    <p>So, for example: If you did 4 sets of 5 with 30kg in week 1 on your bench press, the following week you should aim to either up the weight or the sets.<br>
    This would look like this:</p>
    <ul>
   <li> Week 1: 4x5 30kg</li>
   <li> Week 2: 4x5 32.5kg</li>
   <li>Week 3: 4x6 32.5kg</li>
    </ul>
   <p> In week 2, we added weight but in week 3 we weren't confident in adding weight so we did 4 sets of 6 at the same weight. Both ways are still implimenting progressive overload.</p>

    <h3>Compound Movements</h3>
    <p>Compound Movements are exercises that incorporate more than one muscle group. Working multiple muscle groups at once allows us to move more weight and impliment progressive overload more easily as a result.<br>
    We are also giving stimulus to more than one muscle at a time which is beneficial for growth.</p>
    <p>Some Common Compund Lifts include:<br><a href="split.html#benchpress"> The Bench Press</a> <br>
    <a href="split.html#ohp"> Overhead Press</a><br><a href="split.html#row"> Barbell Row</a>
    <br><a href="split.html#squat"> Squat</a><br><a href="split.html#deadlift"> Deadlift</a></p>
    <div id="pushday">
    <h2>Push Day</h2>
    <p>On Push Day we want to hit our chest, shoulders and triceps.<br> The reason we call this "Push Day" is because all the exercises we do on this day involve a pushing motion.</p>
<div id="benchpress">
        <h3>Bench Press</h3>
    <p>The Bench Press is a compound movement. As such it is very important for building strength and muscle mass for a beginner.<br>
    The muscles used in the Bench Press are: Chest, Front Delt (Front of shoulder) and the Tricep.<br>
    However, we are primarily targeting the chest here.<br>
    Here is a video explaining how the lift is performed: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcBig73ojpE" target="_blank">Bench Press</a></p>
</div>
<div id="ohp">
    <h3>Overhead Press</h3>
<p>The Overhead Press is also a compound movement.<br>
The muscles used in the Overhead Press are: Front Delt (Front of shoulder), Medial Delt (Side of shoulder) and the Tricep.<br>
However, we are primarily targeting the front delt here.<br>
Here is a video explaining how the lift is performed: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RlRDWO2jfg" target="_blank">Overhead Press</a></p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Incline Dumbell Press</h3>
<p>The Incline dumbell press is an upper-chest focused exercise.<br>
The muscles used in the Incline Dumbell Press are: Front Delt (Front of shoulder), Upper Chest and the Tricep.<br>
However, we are primarily targeting the upper chest here.<br>
Here is a video explaining how the lift is performed: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G2_XV7slIg&" target="_blank">Incline Dumbell Press</a></p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Tricep Push-Down</h3>
<p>The Tricep Push-Down is an isolation exercise for the tricep, meaning all the work is being done by the triceps<br>
    We add this in to the routine as the tricep is only hit in a secondary way for the compound lifts, so we just need to give it a bit more work.
Here is a video explaining how the lift is performed: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jxrjl4B8-U" target="_blank">Tricep Push-Down</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="pullday">
<h2>Pull Day</h2>
 <p>On Pull Day we want to hit our back and biceps.<br> The reason we call this "Pull Day" is because all the exercises we do on this day involve a pulling motion.</p>

 <div id="row">
    <h3>Barbell Row</h3>
<p>The Barbell Row is also a compound movement.<br>
The muscles used in the Barbell Row are: The lats, rhomboids (upper back), erectors (stabilisation muscles in the back) and the biceps.<br>
However, we are focussing on hitting the overall back here with some support from the biceps.<br>
Here is a video explaining how the lift is performed: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBWAon7ItDw&" target="_blank">Barbell Row</a></p>  
 </div>
 <h3>Lat Pull-Down</h3>
<p>The muscles used in the Lat Pull-Down are: The lats, rhomboids (upper back), erectors (stabilisation muscles in the back) and the biceps.<br>
However, we are focussing on hitting the Lats here with some support from the biceps.<br>
The lats are the main muscle group responsible for creating the much-desired "V-tapre" body shape.<br>
Think of the Lat-Pull down as a pull-up where you are pulling the bar down to you instead of yourself to the bar.<br>
Here is a video explaining how the lift is performed: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O94yEoGXtBY" target="_blank">Lat Pull-Down</a></p>  

<h3>Chest-Supported Seated Row</h3>
<p> This is usually done on a machine.<br>
    The muscles used in the Chest-Supported Seated Row are: The lats, rhomboids (upper back), and the biceps.<br>
    However, we are focussing on hitting the Rhomboids and Lats here with some support from the biceps.<br>
    The upper back is hit hardest here which we need as it was mainly a support in the other 2 lifts.<br>
    Here is a video explaining how the lift is performed: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EP5HpKtJG0" target="_blank">Chest-Supported Seated Row</a></p>  

    <h3>Preacher Curl</h3>
    <p> This is an isolation exercise to further hit the biceps.<br>
        We need to hit the biceps with an isolation exercise as the other lifts only had support from the biceps.<br>
        This exercise may be hard to progressive overload as biceps are a small muscle group, but be patient and they will grow!<br>
        Here is a video explaining how the lift is performed: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-xvtHS9PsU" target="_blank">Preacher Curl</a></p>

</div>
<div id="legs">
    <h2>Leg Day</h2>
    <p>Squats and Deadlifts are both very taxing compound lifts. For this reason we want to alternate between the two. So, on your first leg day you will squat then on the next leg day you will deadlift. Try not to do both on the same day.</p>
    <div id="squat">
        <h3>Squat</h3>
    <p>The Squat is also a compound movement.<br>
    The muscles used in the Squat are: The Quad, Hamstring, Glutes and Calves.<br>
    However, we are primarily targeting the quads and glutes here.<br>
    Here is a video explaining how the lift is performed: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEv6CCg2BC8" target="_blank">Squat</a></p>
    </div>
    <div id="deadlift">
        <h3>Deadlift</h3>
    <p>The Deadlift is also a compound movement.<br>
    The muscles used in the Deadlift are: The Hamstring, Glutes and erectors(back stabilisation muscles).<br>
    However, we are primarily targeting the hamstrings and glutes here.<br>
    Deadlifts are the one exercise that people tend to have terrible form, so make sure to go light and focus on your form before jumping up in the weight. Your back will thank you.<br>
    Here is a video explaining how the lift is performed: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL5Ab0T07e4" target="_blank">Deadlift</a></p>
    </div>
    <h3>Leg press</h3>
    <p>Leg Press is a machine exercise<br>
        This is a Quad isolation exercise and will help us hit that quad with a bit more concentration after it was hit by the squats.<br>
        There is also a variation to focus more on the hamstrings and glutes depending on foot position.<br>
        Here is a video explaining how the lift is performed with the variations included: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8cCEQh-CE" target="_blank">Leg Press</a></p>

     <h3>Leg Extention</h3>
<p>Leg Extentions are a machine exercise<br>
        This is also a Quad isolation exercise and will help us hit that quad with a bit more concentration after it was hit by the squats and leg press.<br>
        Here is a video explaining how the lift is performed: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljO4jkwv8wQ" target="_blank">Leg Extentions</a></p>
    
    <h3>Hamstring Curls</h3>
    <p>Hamstring Curls are also a machine exercise<br>
         This is a hamstring isolation exercise, as we have been hitting quads we need to hit the hamstrings for a complete leg day. Although this will be the final exercise of the day.<br>
         Here is a video explaining how the lift is performed: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F488k67BTNo" target="_blank">Hamstring Curls</a></p>
